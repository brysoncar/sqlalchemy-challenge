SQl Alchemy Bootcamp Homework: using an ORM and python code to create a session with two SQL tables and run queries on those tables. 

Included is one .sqllite file: one for the schema, and two csv files fo the tables. 

As usual, I did get help with the code to import the files from a coworker. Finding the correct commands was a struggle, as often my results were not in the correct format to continue with my plan, so I did get help from chatgpt to get results in the right format to then run further queries on.
